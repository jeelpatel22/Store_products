# Web Development Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on web development and project management using command-line build environments, automated testing, and validation tools. The primary goal was to create and structure a web project while ensuring code quality, formatting, and validation.

## Key Features

- Implemented a web project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `src/` directory.
- Utilized npm (Node Package Manager) to manage project dependencies and build scripts.
- Implemented a web server for testing and previewing the project locally.
- Employed Prettier for code formatting to maintain code consistency.
- Used ESLint for JavaScript code analysis and error checking.
- Applied Stylelint for CSS code analysis and error checking.
- Validated HTML files using the HTML5 validator.
- Created a comprehensive build script, `npm run prepare-submission`, to automate code formatting, validation, and error checking.
- Prepared the project for submission by packaging it into an archive, typically named `project-archive.zip`, suitable for archiving and sharing.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Use various npm scripts like `npm run server` to start a local server for testing, `npm run prettier` for code formatting, `npm run eslint` for JavaScript error checking, `npm run stylelint` for CSS error checking, and `npm run validate` for HTML validation.
4. For comprehensive preparation for submission, run `npm run prepare-archive` to format, validate, and check all code components.
